# Caspian in JavaFX 19 (OpenJFX)
The caspian folder is extracted from: javafx-controls-19-win\com\sun\javafx\scene\control\skin
A lot of developers want to know the CSS so that they can easily override specific parts of the CSS in their applications.
Since JavaFX (OpenJFX) is open source, I extracted entire folder containing the core CSS files and images from the jar file and put it here.
I hope this will help you understand the CSS structure and override it more easily.

Beware that this is extracted from Windows and there may be platform specific CSS rules/hacks in it.

## Only interested in the core CSS file?
